TODO ---

- periodically purge "dangling" sessions whose Account ID no longer pertains to
  an existing Account instance (infrequent)

- consider service that requires websockets - how would a connection work
  through the gateway?

- concurrent requests may invoke closeSequelize()

- account deletion should notify profile service so it can delete corresponding
  profile

- add Java HttpClient/HttpBridge, RandomService/RandomManager, and
  TimeService/TimeManager to reference code

- change all verifyAuthorityContainsAtLeastOneRole() calls to variables

- change all validateConfig() to configure()

- null or empty string for host or port config should use localhost and 80
