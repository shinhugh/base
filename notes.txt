TODO ---

- consider service that requires websockets - how would a connection work
  through the gateway?

- occasionally purge "dangling" sessions? - account delete calls that failed to
  delete corresponding sessions due to unexpected errors

- occasionally purge "dangling" profiles? - account delete calls that failed to
  delete corresponding profiles due to unexpected errors

- consider letter cases for queries and conflict checks
  - database: case-sensitive
  - repository read/update/delete (matching): configurable by parameter



- Accounts.Id - service transforms input to lowercase
- Accounts.Name - service.read/update/delete does case-sensitive search for
  initial match
  service.create/update does case-insensitive search to check for conflict
- Accounts.PasswordHash - fine
- Accounts.PasswordSalt - fine
- PersistentSessions.Id - service transforms input to lowercase
- PersistentSessions.AccountId - service transforms input to lowercase
- PersistentSessions.RefreshToken - fine

- Profiles.AccountId - service transforms input to lowercase
- Profiles.Name - service.read does case-insensitive search
