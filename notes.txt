TODO ---

- consider service that requires websockets - how would a connection work
  through the gateway?

- occasionally purge "dangling" profiles? - account delete calls that failed to
  delete corresponding profiles due to unexpected errors

- profile service should:
  - create queue "profile"
  - bind queue to exchange "account" with routing key "account.delete"
  - handle event by deleting profile x where x.accountId == event.id
