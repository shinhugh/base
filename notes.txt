TODO ---

- build profile service (CRUD)

- periodically purge "dangling" sessions whose Account ID no longer pertains to
  an existing Account instance (infrequent)

- consider service that requires websockets - how would a connection work
  through the gateway?

- concurrent requests may invoke closeSequelize()

- delete existing account service and rename authentication service to account
  service
