TODO ---

- consider service that requires websockets - how would a connection work
  through the gateway?

- concurrent requests may invoke closeSequelize()

- account deletion should notify profile service so it can delete corresponding
  profile

- add Java HttpClient/HttpBridge, RandomService/RandomManager, and
  TimeService/TimeManager to reference code
