TODO ---

- consider service that requires websockets - how would a connection work
  through the gateway?

- occasionally purge "dangling" sessions? - account delete calls that failed to
  delete corresponding sessions due to unexpected errors

- occasionally purge "dangling" profiles? - account delete calls that failed to
  delete corresponding profiles due to unexpected errors

- profile service's AMQP connection keeps breaking
  - diagnose what's causing connection to break
  - implement mechanism to reestablish connection upon break
